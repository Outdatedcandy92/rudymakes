## About

Hi there! I'm Rudraksh. I go by Rudy or Outdatedcandy92 online. I'm a 17 year old maker from toronto who love to make PCBs and hack hardware.

I’ve done some cool stuff like:
- Organized a [Hackathon](https://daydream.hackclub.com/toronto) @ Shopify Toronto for teenagers
- Ran my own [online programs](https://picoducky.hackclub.com/) in Hack Club
- Got one of my projects features on a hardware magazine cover


I'm currently working on:
- [Allwinner V3S SBC](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/V3S-SBC)
- [Audio Development Board](https://github.com/Outdatedcandy92/Audio-Devboard)





Want to get in touch? email me at **rudy[at]rudymakes.com** :D
