# Custom Board Outline

To import and use more complex shapes for your board outline, we can use **DXF files**.

## Image to DXF

First, create the shape you want in a drawing program or find an image online. For the best results, the image should be mostly a solid color with a clearly defined and closed outline.

For my example, I’m using this cat outline that I found online.

Next, I’ll head to a website that can convert images to DXF. I’m using [Convertio](https://convertio.co/jpg-dxf/). I’ll upload my cat image and download it as a DXF file.

## DXF to Board Outline

Once you have the DXF file, go back to the EasyEDA PCB editor and select **File → Import → DXF**.

A dialog will pop up. Here, you need to do two main things. First, set the **Import Layer** to **Board Outline Layer**.

Second, adjust the **Scaling Ratio** so that the imported shape is under 100×100 mm.

Once that’s done, click **Import** to place the board outline in the editor.

In my case, the DXF imported with two sets of outlines, so I just selected one and deleted it.

You’re all done! You’ve successfully imported a custom shape as your board outline :D
